			<h1>Introduction to Java - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Introduction to Java</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to ensure you have your java development
environment and IDE configured correctly and are able to build
and run an application.

Create a new Java project and add a main class which simply prints out
<i>hello world</i> using this example code from the notes:
<pre>
package training;

public class MainHello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
