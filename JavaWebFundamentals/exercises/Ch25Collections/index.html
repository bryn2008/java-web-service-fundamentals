			<h1>Collections - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Collections</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to ...

<li><h2><a id="Lottery"/>UK Lottery</h2>
<p>
A UK lottery ticket entry requires 6 unique numbers between 1 and 59.
Write a program to generate one row of random ticket numbers. Do this by:
</p>
<ol>
<li>create an empty list for the numbers</li>
<li>loop round until the list has 6 numbers</li>
<li>use <b>random.randnext()</b> to generate a number between 1 and 59</li>
<li>add this number to the list if the list does not already contain the number</li>
<li>print out the list</li>
<li>(optional) look at the <b>Collections</b> class to work out how to sort the numbers 
into numerical order before printing the list.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2><a id="Tables"/>Times Tables</h2>
<p>
    Create an array initialised with the numbers 1 to 12 and use this
    as the source data to generate the classic multiplication tables.
    Use and iterative <b>for</b> loop and the <b>format</b>() function
    to print out the table so it looks like:
</p>
<pre>
     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 1   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 2   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24
 3   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36
...
12  12  24  36  48  60  72  84  96 108 120 132 144

<li><h2><a id="Haversine"/>Haversine Distances</h2>
<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula'  target="_new">Haversine Formula</a>
is used to calculate the great circle distance between two points on a sphere. The
formula is evaluated as follows where <b>lat1, lon1</b> and 
<b>lat2, lon2</b> represent the latitude and
longitude of two points (defined as radians) and <b>D</b> is the diameter of the Earth:
</p>
<img src='haversine.png' width='578' height='115'/>
<p>
Write a function that calculates the distance between two locations each defined as an
array of two doubles (<b>double[]</b>). Have the function return the distance in
kilometres (Earth diameter is 12742km); you should use a class level
<b>private static final</b> constant for the earth diameter.
</p>
<p>
Call your function to calculate the distance from Exeter (50.73, -3.54) 
to Heathrow (51.4775, -0.4614) expressed
in km; you should get the result 222.06km. Pass in the values for the
locations as anonymous arrays (use the syntax <b>new double[]{ }</b>).

<li><h2><a id="RPC"/>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
<img class='right' src='r-p-c.png' width='350' height='259' alt='rock paper scissors image'>
<div >
<p>
Rock-paper-scissors is a zero sum hand game played between two people. To play, each player simultaneously 
forms one of three shapes with their hand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>rock - fingers curled in a fist</li>
<li>paper - fingers outstretched in a flat hand</li>
<li>scissors - first and middle fingers outstretched to form a V, other fingers curled</li>
</ul>
<p>The shapes are compared so that the winner is detrmined from:</p>
<ul>
<li>rock blunts scissors</li>
<li>paper wraps rock</li>
<li>scissors cut paper</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a draw, the players select again and continue until a winner emerges or a player quits.
</p>
<p>
Implement your version of the game. Prompt the player for a move (accept either the first letter
or full name of the move), generate a random computer move, compare the results and display the
winner. If there is a draw then loop round and repeat until the user quits or a winner is found.
</p>
<p>
Use a decision matrix to compare the outcome of each game. That is create a 3x3 array and in each
cell indicate the winner where the row is selected by the users choice and the column
is selected by the computers choice. You will need to map rock, paper and scissors into
the numbers 0, 1 and 2 (to index the collection).

<li><h2><a id="Dealer"/>Poker School</h2>
<p>
    Simulate the basic mechanism of a card playing game with a deck of decks and
    players who are each dealt a hard of cards from the deck. A card can be simulated
    using a number between 0 and 51. A card's face value will be the card number modulo (remainder) 
    13 and the suit will be the card number divided by 13 (rank the suits clubs 0, diamonds 1,
    hearts 2 and spades 3). The card deck and the player's hands will be simulated
    using <b>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</b> objects.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of steps you will need to follow to develop this program:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an array list to hold the deck of cards and fill this list with integer
values from 0 to 51 (you'll need to use a counted <b>for</b> loop to do this)
</li>
<li>Create a class level (<b>private static</b>) method to shuffle the deck of cards. This
method should have a <b>List&lt;Integer&gt;</b> parameter which is the deck to shuffle 
and return <b>void</b> as the list will be modified directly. The shuffle algorithm should
loop through every card in the deck and swap it with any other card in the deck: use a
random index value between 0 and 51 to select which card to swap with the current card - it
is possible and valid for a card to be swapped with itself and therefore not change position
within the deck. Call this function to shuffle the deck.
</li>
<li>Create a list of players each of which is represented by an empty <b>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</b>.
This list (the poker table) will be declared as <b>List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;</b>: use
the <b>Arrays.asList</b>() method to initialise this list.
</li>
<li> Create a class level (<b>private static</b>) method to deal the deck of cards to
the players. You will need to pass in the deck of cards (a list), the list of players
(a list of lists), and the number of cards to deal to each player. This method
will return <b>void</b> as the deck and players hands passed as parameters 
will be modified directly. Use a <i>proper</i>
dealing algorithm that uses a counted loop to deal <i>n</i> cards one at a time to each player: 
use an inner iterative loop to <i>deal</i> a card to each player by using the 
<b>List.remove(0)</b> method to take the next card from the front of the deck and
add it to the players hand. Call your deal method to deal 5 cards to each player.
</li>
<li> Define another class level method to print out a list of cards. This method
should take a string <i>name</i> parameter and a card list (either a deckor a player's hand)
and print out the card number as a value and suit. You will find these lookup strings useful
for converting the value (number%13) and suit (number/13) to characters:
<pre>
private static final String SUITS = "CDHS";
private static final String VALUES = "A23456789TJQK";
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Use your printer function to print out the player's hands and the cards left in the deck. 
format your output in a similar manner to the following:
<pre>
Doyle     : 4D AD AD 3S 3H
Bill      : AC 3S 2D 2D 2C
Henry     : AH 3S 3D 2H 3H
Deck      : 2S 3C 4S AD 4D 2C 2S 4C ...
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Strictly optional and no solution is provided but extend you program to compare the
players hands and declare a winner using standard
