			<h1>Unit Testing - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Unit Testing</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to practice developing code using a Test Drievn 
Development approach where you develop the tests in parallel with the code, and
start with each test case.
</p>
<ol>

<li><h2><a id="Triangle"/>Testing the Triangle class</h2>
<p>
To start with you will need to add the JUnit and Hamcrest dependencies to your POM file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.12&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.hamcrest&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;hamcrest-all&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Create your Java test files in 
a package in the <b>src/test/java</b> folder. Don't forget
to include the following <b>import</b> in your test files:
</p>
<pre>
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
</pre>
<p>
<p>
In a previous exercise you were asked to
define a class to represent a triangle storing the lengths of the three sides
of the triangle including methods to indicate if the triangle is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>isosceles (two sides of the same length)</li>
<li>equilateral (all sides the same length)</li>
<li>right angled
(sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest
side)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>DO NOT</b> use your existing class but start again with a new class called
<b>TriangleShape</b> and develop this class in combination with JUnit test cases.
Do this in the following stages:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <b>TriangleShape</b> class with a single constructor that takes a
<b>double[]</b> parameter - do not create any attributes or add code to this constructor.</li>
<li>Add a <b>public List&lt;Double&gt; getSides()</b> method to this class that returns an
empty <b>ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</b>.</li>
<li>Create a test class to create a triangle with sides of [2,3,4] and test that the
number of sides returned by the <b>getSides()</b> method is 3 and that the list 
contains values [2,3,4]. This test should fail. You will find the Hamcrest 
<b>containsInAnyOrder</b>() method useful for this test. For example:
<pre>
List&lt;String&gt; collection = Lists.newArrayList("ab", "cd", "ef");
assertThat(collection, containsInAnyOrder("cd", "ab", "ef"));
</pre></li>
<li>Update your class to make this test pass.</li>
<li>Add a (failing) test to create a triangle with only two sides [2,3] and verify that
an <i>expected</i> <b>IllegalArgumentException is thrown.</b></li>
<li>Update your class to make this test pass.</li>
<li>Add a test to create a triangle with four sides [2,3] and verify that
an <i>expected</i> <b>IllegalArgumentException</b> is thrown. If this test doesn't pass
update your class to make it pass.</li>
<li>Add an outline <b>boolean isIsosceles()</b> method that always returns false.</li>
<li>Create a test for an isosceles triangle [3,3,2] and update your class to make this pass.</li>
<li>Test non isosceles triangles [2,3,4] and [3,3,3] (equilateral is not isosceles).</li>
<li>Create a test for an equilateral  triangle [3,3,3] and update your class to make this pass.</li>
<li>Test non equilateral triangles .</li>
<li>Add a test for right angled triangles ([3,4,5]) and update your class to make this pass, test an
isosceles triangle that is also right angled, and a non right angled triangle.</li>
</ol>
