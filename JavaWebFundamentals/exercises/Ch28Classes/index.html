			<h1>Classes &amp; Objects - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Classes &amp; Objects</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to define classes, create objects and
work with attributes, properties and instance methods.
</p>
<p>Use Logback for writing messages to the console, directly writing to <b>System.out</b> no longer allowed.</p>

<li><h2><a id="Triangle"/>Triangles</h2>
<p>
Define a class to represent a triangle storing the lengths of the three sides
of the triangle. Add methods to indicate if the triangle is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>isosceles (two sides of the same length)</li>
<li>equilateral (all sides the same length)</li>
<li>right angled
(sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest
side)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be able to specify the side lengths in any order when creating the 
triangle (no need to supply them in ascending or descending order). Store the sides
in an array of three doubles and sort these so that the longest side is the last
entry in the array (this will make checking for right angled triangles easier).
</p>
<p>Throw an <b>IllegalArgumentException</b> to reject an attempt to create 
an invalid triangle where the sum of the lengths
of the shorter sides is less than or equal to the length of the longest side, or
any of the sides are zero or negative.
</p>
<p>Provide two constructors, one takes an array of three side lengths as doubles
(check there are exactly 3 sides) and one with 3 separate double values for the sides. Use
constructor chaining (a <b>this()</b> method call) to implement one of these
constructors.
</p>
<p>
Test your program with suitable values such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2, 3, 4 - plain triangle</li>
<li>3, 3, 2 - isosceles</li>
<li>3, 3, 3 - equilateral</li>
<li>5, 4, 3 - right angled</li>
<li>1, 2, 3 - invalid</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Lottery"/>Lottery</h2>
<p>Create a class representing a lottery ticket to store a set
    of 6 unique numbers (create a <b>TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;</b> to hold the numbers). 
    In the initialisation method generate 6 randomly chosen
    numbers between 1 and 59 using <b>Random.nextInt</b>().</p>
<p>
Add a method to the class to match this ticket against another ticket and 
return a <b>List</b> of the matched numbers - you will find the <b>retainAll</b>() method
useful for matching the numbers in both tickets. Add a <b>toString</b>() that
shows the numbers in the ticket - you don't need any getter or setter methods
for this class.</p>
<p>In a test class create a list of 10 lottery tickets 
and generate a <i>draw</i> ticket. Print out the
draw ticket numbers, and each tickets numbers indicating how many
numbers matched - add the string 'WINNER' to any with 3 or more matched
numbers.
</p>
<p>
Add a second constructor that accepts a list of integers as a parameter
and save these numbers in the ticket. Validate the the saved set of numbers
is of the correct size (6) and all numbers are within the permitted
range (1..59).

<li><h2><a id="Planets"/>Planetary Data</h2>
<p>Starting with the following table of planetary data:
</p>
<table><thead><tr><td>Planet</td><td>AU from Sun</td><td>Diameter</td></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>"Mercury",</td><td>0.39,</td><td>4879</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Neptune",</td><td>30.06,</td><td>49528</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Jupiter",</td><td>5.2,</td><td>142984</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Uranus",</td><td>19.18,</td><td>51118</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Mars",</td><td>1.52,</td><td>6792</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Earth",</td><td>1,</td><td>12756</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Venus",</td><td>0.72,</td><td>12104</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Saturn",</td><td>9.54,</td><td>120536</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Define a class to store planetary data of name, distance from the sun (double)
and diameter (int). Provide a constructor to create a planet and getter methods
for each attribute (name, distance and diameter). You can  copy and paste 
from the table to quickly create the parameter list
needed to invoke a planet constructor.
</p>
<p>
Create a second <b>SolarSystem</b> class that holds a list of individual
planets and have its constructor initialise the list of planets. Have this
class define a <b>list</b>() method that returns a <i>copy</i> of the list of planets.
</p>
<p>In a main test method create the solar system
and then print out the planet list so that the names and
planetary data are shown in columns as follows:
</p>
<pre>
Mercury      0.39     4879
Neptune     30.06    49528
Jupiter      5.20   142984
Uranus      19.18    51118
Mars         1.52     6792
Earth        1.00    12756
Venus        0.72    12104
Saturn       9.54   120536
</pre>
