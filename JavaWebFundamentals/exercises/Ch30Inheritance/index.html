			<h1>Inheritance - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Inheritance</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to work with class inheritance and polymorphic
methods (overriding). These exercises should be attempted in the order they are given
as you are building a simple graphics management application utilising the Java
OO design principles.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b> that for this and all subsequent exercises you should not create any <b>main</b>
methods but use JUnit test cases to exercise the functionality of the classes you will
write. Develop the tests concurrently with the code, writing both feature and test at the
same time.
</p>
<ol>

<li><h2><a id="Exception"/>User Defined Exceptions</h2>
<p>
Very few Java applications can be written without using domain specific exceptions (user defined
exceptions) to report errors. Following the style of the example in the course notes create a
<b>ShapeException</b> class which sub classes <b>RuntimeException</b>.
Initially provide one constructor with the parameters:</p>
<pre>
ShapeException(String format, Object... args)
</pre>
<p>
This allows an object to be created using a format string and arguments: the body of the constructor
should pass these parameters to <b>String.format</b> to get the error string required to
initialise the super class constructor.
</p>
<p>Write a JUnit test case that throws this exception with any suitable error message.</p>
<p>Add a second constructor that has an additional initial argument of an <b>Exception</b>
so you can warp your domain exception around an underlying problem. Write a JUnit test
for this exception by writing code that will throw an exception such as:
</p>
<pre>
double width = Double.parseDouble("20mm");
</pre>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Exception">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Shape"/>Generalised Shape</h2>
<p>Create a class to represent a geometric shape where all shapes have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a colour attribute (use the <b>java.awt.Color</b> type to hold the colour)</li>
<li>an area property</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide <i>getter</i> methods for both the colour and the area. As a generic shape has no area
simply return 0, the sub classes will override this method: the area is a <b>double</b> property.
</p>
<p>Write test case to create a shape object and verify it's colour and area.</p> 

<p><a href="solutions.html#Shape">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Rectangle"/>Rectangle</h2>
<p>
Define a <b>Rectangle</b> sub class of <b>Shape</b> which requires a constructor
to set the length, width and colour. Validate that the length and width are both
greater than zero and report errors using your <b>ShapeException</b> class. The area of a
rectangle is given by:
</p>
<img src='rectangle.png' width='246' height='80'/>
<p>Write test cases for your rectangle class, especially don't forget
to check the error handling works as expected.
</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Rectangle">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Triangle"/>Triangle</h2>
<p>
Define a <b>Triangle</b> sub class of <b>Shape</b> which requires a constructor
to set the sides using a <b>double[]</b>, and colour. Validate that the sides are all
greater than zero, the triangle is valid, and report errors using your <b>ShapeException</b> class. The area of a
triangle is given by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula" target=_new>Heron's formula:</a>
</p>
<img src='herons.png' width='318' height='148'/>
<p>Write test cases for your triangle class including
checks that the error handling works as expected.
</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Triangle">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Abstract"/>Refactor Shape to be Abstract</h2>
<p>
Refactor your shape class so that it is <b>abstract</b> and replace your dummy
implementation of <b>getArea</b>(0 with an <b>abstract</b> method. Your shape test case
should now fail as you can no longer create a <b>Shape</b> object. You should delete this test. 
</p>
<p>
Note that while JUnit supports an <b>@Ignore</b> annotation to temporarily disable a test
during development it is not applicable in this case as the test is now redundant:
there is no intention of changing this code to make the test valid again. And, more
obviously, the test case will no longer compile.
</p>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Drawing"/>Drawing Package</h2>
<p>
Create a class to represent a drawing which comprises a list of shapes. Add a method to this
class to return the total area of all the shapes: <b>double getShapeArea()</b>. Write a test
case to add 5 shapes (some rectangle and some triangles) to the drawing and validate the
area of all the added shapes.
</p>

<p><a href="solutions.html#Drawing">Solutions</a></p>
</li>

<li><h2><a id="Enum"/>Add Enumerated Triangle Type</h2>
<p>
Refactor your triangle class to include a <b>getCategory</b>() method that
returns the category (type) of triangle: plain, isosceles, equilateral or right-angled. 
To simplify the problem, a triangle can only belong to one category so an isoceles right angled triangle will
be considered to be isosceles. Use an <b>enum</b> to represent the triangle
category (create the <b>enum</b> as a nested <b>public static class</b> in the <b>Triangle</b>
class. Write test cases for different categories of tiangle.
