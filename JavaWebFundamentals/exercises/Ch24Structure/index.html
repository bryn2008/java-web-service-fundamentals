			<h1>Program Structure - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Program Structure</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to ...
</p>
<ol>

<li><h2><a id="Guess"/>Guessing Game</h2>
<p>
Generate a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). Using a <b>do-while</b>
loop enter the loop and prompt the user to
guess the number. If the user guesses correctly print out <i>Good Guess</i>
and <b>break</b> out of the loop. If their guess
was not zero print out whether their guess was lower or higher then the
generated number and loop round again if the guess is not equal to zero.

<li><h2><a id="Ordnance"/>Projectile Paths</h2>
<p>The path of projectiles such as a cannon ball (or an angry bird) when
ignoring air resistance is given by several equations:

<p>
<p>Write a function to help your armourers:</p>
<ol>
<li>call the function <b>launchAngle</b>()</li>
<li>pass the velocity as the first parameter</li>
<li>pass the required range as the second parameter</li>
<li>return the calculated launch angle theta in degrees rounded to the nearest whole number</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <b>Math</b> trigonometric functions work in radians so
you will need to convert the calculated angle <i>to degrees</i>.
</p>
<p>Write a program that uses your function to calculate the launch angle theta for 
a range of 1000m with an initial velocity of 100.0 m/s.
</p>
<p>
Write a second function <b>calcRange</b>() that will return the range given two parameters of 
initial velocity and launch angle (in degrees). Verify your 
original launch angle by passing
this (with an initial velocity of 100.0 m/s) into this function to check you
get back the original range of 1000m, if not can you explain why you don't get back
the original range?

<li><h2><a id="Counting"/>Traditional Counting System</h2>
<p> 
It is known that some traditional cultures only have words for one, two, and many. To
illustrate a variation on this counting system
this write a program to use a <b>for</b> loop to generate 10
random numbers between 1 and 10 using <b>random.nextInt(10)+1</b>. Inside the
loop use a <b>switch</b> statement to map the following numbers to names:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1</b> - one</li>
<li><b>2</b> - two</li>
<li><b>10</b> - two hands full</li>
<li><i>all other numbers</i> - many</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have Internet access there is an early <a href="https://xkcd.com/764/"  target="_new">XKCD page</a> showing
traditional counting systems.
</p>

</li>

<li><h2><a id="Overload"/>Overloaded Random Number Generators</h2>
<p>
This question is an example of using overloaded method  where the same method name, in this
case <b>generator</b>, is defined with different parameter lists so that the
method signature (name combined with the parameter types) is unique.
</p>
<p>
Define a class method (<b>private static</b>) called <b>generate</b> that accepts a 
single <b>int</b> parameter and returns a random integer between 1 and the value of the
parameter.
</p>
<p>
Define a second <b>generate</b> method that accepts two <b>int</b> parameters and returns
a random integer between these values (inclusive). 
</p>
<p>You should create a <b>final</b> 
class level variable to hold the <b>Random</b> object so that it is shared bewteen
the methods, rather than have each method create a new <b>Random</b> object each time they
are called.
</p>
<p>
You should be able to call these methods as follows:</p>
<pre>
System.out.println(generate(10));
System.out.println(generate(1,59));
</pre>
