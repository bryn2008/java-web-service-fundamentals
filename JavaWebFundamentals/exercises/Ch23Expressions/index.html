			<h1>Expressions - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Expressions</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to work with expression evaluation to understand
operators, operands, precedence and data conversion; and to work with string methods and formatted strings.
</p>

<li><h2><a id="Tables"/>Times Tables</h2>
<p>Use two nested <b>for</b> loops to print out the classic children's times table
    so that it looks like:
</p>
<pre>
     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 1   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 2   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24
 3   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36
...
12  12  24  36  48  60  72  84  96 108 120 132 144
</pre>
<p>
Initially use the <b>Sysytem.out.format</b>() method to format each number separately in a
field width of 4 characters. At the end of each row use <b>Sysytem.out.println()</b>
to generate the end of line marker. You will need to use a separate for loop for the
first (header) line.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your program working refactor it so that each row of numbers is
appended to a <b>StringBuilder</b> object and <b>Sysytem.out.println</b>() is
used to print the row: you will need to use <b>String.format</b>() to create the
string to append to the string builder. Use a <b>StringBuilder</b> to build up
the header line as well.

<li><h2><a id="Ordnance"/>Projectile Paths</h2>
<p>The path of projectiles such as a cannon ball (or an angry bird) when
ignoring air resistance is given by several equations:

<p>
Write a program to calculate the launch angle theta when the 
range is 100m and the initial velocity 35 m/s. Remember to convert theta from
radians to degrees when you print out the value (which should be 26.6 degrees).
Now, feed your angle of theta (in radians) back into the range equation to verify the distance as 100m.
</p>
<p>
You will find the functions you need in the <b>Math</b> package, in particular
you will need to use <b>asin</b>() (for arcsin), <b>sin</b>(), <b>cos</b>(),
<b>pow</b>() (for power or exponent), <b>toDegrees</b>() and <b>toRadians</b>().

<li><h2><a id="Guess"/>Guessing Game</h2>
<p>
Generate a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). Prompt the user to
guess the number. If the user guesses correctly print out <i>Good Guess</i>
otherwise print out whether their guess was lower or higher then the
generated number. Finally print out the generated number.
</p>
<p>
Refactor (refine) your program to allow the user to guess again by looping
round until the user guesses correctly or enters 0 to stop the program.
</p>

<li><h2><a id="Check"/>Prime Number Check</h2>
<p>Write a program that reads a single integer from the user and
then prints out if that number is prime.</p>
<p>A prime number is a number greater than one that cannot be exactly divided by any
    number other than itself and one. You can speed up your test by only
    considering the odd numbers up to 50% of the number you are testing.
Do this in your solution by using a <b>for</b> loop to step through odd numbers from 3 up
to half of the user's input number.
<p>
Refactor you solution to loop round reading integers from the user 
while they enter values greater than one.

<li><h2><a id="Haversine"/>Haversine Distances</h2>
<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula'  target="_new">Haversine Formula</a>
is used to calculate the great circle distance between two points on a sphere. The
formula is evaluated as follows where <b>lat1, lon1</b> and 
<b>lat2, lon2</b> represent the latitude and
longitude of two points (defined as radians) and <b>D</b> is the diameter of the Earth:
</p>

<p>
Write a program that calculates the distance from Exeter (50.73, -3.54) 
to Heathrow (51.4775, -0.4614) expressed
in km (Earth diameter is 12742km). You should get the result 222.06km. You will
find all the functions you need in the <b>Math</b> package, and you will
need to convert the latitude and longitude degrees to radians for use in the trigonometric
functions.
