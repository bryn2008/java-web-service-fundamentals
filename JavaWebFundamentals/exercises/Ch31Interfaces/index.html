			<h1>Interfaces - Questions</h1>

			<p>
				These exercises are designed to expand on the topics introduced
				in the
				<strong>Interfaces</strong>
				chapter of the Java Development training course.
			</p>

			<p>You can attempt the exercises in any order but the later
				exercises tend to be more complex and require more time to complete. You
				are not expected to complete all the exercises in the time available.
				Just do as many as you can do, or want to do, and
				try to find time after the course has finished to return to complete
				these exercises. If you are unsure what to do, or need advice
				as you work through the exercises then please ask your
				instructor for additional information.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of these exercises is to work with classes that implement interfaces and
to specify class behaviour through interfaces. Continue to use JUnit test cases to exercise the functionality 
of the classes you develop.

<li><h2><a id="Sorting"/>Sorting Planetary Data</h2>
<p>
In a previous chapter your were asked to define a class to represent a
planet and another to represent the solar system holding a list of planets
initialised with the following data:
</p>
<table><thead><tr><td>Planet</td><td>AU from Sun</td><td>Diameter</td></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>"Mercury",</td><td>0.39,</td><td>4879</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Neptune",</td><td>30.06,</td><td>49528</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Jupiter",</td><td>5.2,</td><td>142984</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Uranus",</td><td>19.18,</td><td>51118</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Mars",</td><td>1.52,</td><td>6792</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Earth",</td><td>1,</td><td>12756</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Venus",</td><td>0.72,</td><td>12104</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Saturn",</td><td>9.54,</td><td>120536</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Use your solution to the previous exercise or the following classes as a starting point for this
question:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Planet.java" target="src">Planet.java</a></li>
<li><a href="SolarSystem.java" target="src">SolarSystem.java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
You will not need to change the <b>Planet</b> class but will be extending the
<b>SolarSystem</b> class to include additional functionality.
</p>
<p>
Add a <b>ListByDistance</b>() method to the <b>SolarSystem</b> class to return a copy
of the planet is sorted by distance from the sun so that the first entry is Mercury, and
the last is Neptune. You will need to define a class that implements the
<b>Comparator&lt;Planet&gt;</b> interface. Write a test case for your class.
</p>
<p>
Add a second <b>SolarSystem.listByDiameter</b>() method and have this use an anonymous
class (of type <b>Comparator&lt;Planet&gt;</b>) to return a copy of the planet list sorted by diameter. Write a test
case for this method.
</p>

<li><h2><a id="Shapes"/>Shape Refactoring</h2>
<p>
In the previous exercises on inheritance you created a hierarchy of shapes sub classes a 
<b>Shape</b> super class. This question asks you to refactor your solution to use
an interface to represent a shape.
</p>
<p>
Use your solution to the previous exercise or the following classes as a starting point for this
question:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Shape.java" target="src">Shape.java</a></li>
<li><a href="Rectangle.java" target="src">Rectangle.java</a></li>
<li><a href="TestShapes.java" target="src">TestShapes.java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Refactor the shape class by extract the <b>getColor</b>() and <b>getArea</b>() methods into an interface
and gave the <b>Shape</b> class implement this interface. If you rename the <b>Shape</b> class to
<b>ShapeBase</b> and call the Interface <b>Shape</b> then you need only change the sub class
name of the super class in sub class definitions (<b>Rectangle</b> et al) - all other code, such the
test cases, should still work using the <b>Shape</b> type.  
</p>

<li><h2><a id="Stratgey"/>Search Strategy</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" target="pattern">Strategy Design Pattern</a>
is a powerful technique that relies on interfaces. A strategy allows a developer to write a generic algorithm
within a class whilst allowing consumers of that class to refine the algorithm to meet their specific requirements.
</p>
<p>
A simple search strategy example can be applied to the <b>Drawing</b> class using in a previous exercise on inheritance
by defining a suitable interface. 
If you have completed the previous question from this chapter you can use this as your starting point and include
the following class:
<ul>
<li><a href="Drawing.java" target="src">Drawing.java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't completed the previous question then use your classes from the
drawing example from the inheritance chapter,
or the following starter classes :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Shape.java" target="src">Shape.java</a></li>
<li><a href="Triangle.java" target="src">Triangle.java</a></li>
<li><a href="Rectangle.java" target="src">Rectangle.java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
You are going to define an interface called <b>Selector</b> that will include a single method 
to decide is a shape should be selected. A suitable signature is:
</p>
<pre>
boolean select(Shape shape);
</pre>
<p>
Extend the <b>Drawing</b> class to include a method that takes a <b>Selector</b> object and
returns a list of those shapes that have been selected (ie. the <b>select</b> method
returns <b>true</b>). 
</p>
<p>
Write a test case that adds sample shapes to the <b>Drawing</b> and then define a selector that will
select some of these shapes (for example blue shapes with an area greater than 5.0) and verify that
the correct number and total are of the shapes selected agrees wit your test data.
